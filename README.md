# React Table

This is a small application which displays fetched data. 

There are some options: 
1. Sorting: first click on the row's title makes sort in ascending order and next one makes it descending.
2. Filtering: typing letters activate case-insensitive search in all fields. 
3. Showing person's card: clicking on a row displays a card in the bottom with the full info (from API).
4. Adding a person: add a person to the top of the table by clicking blue button.)
